### Description
This project is based on an interest that I explored with Game Theory. The minimax algorithm is a game solving decision rule that I explored in Java. I also implemented the alpha-beta pruning optimizations as well as game specific optimizations including intelligent bitwise operations. The games included for this project include: connect-four, mancala and TotalTakeOver.

TotalTakeOver is a game concept that I developed myself that is played against several AI players. The objective of the game is to take over resource tiles to build an army while also protecting your bases and attacking your enemies.
